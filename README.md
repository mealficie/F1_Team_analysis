# F1_Team_analysis
Before starting the visualization, data was loaded from Wikipedia pages. Then the data was cleaned and some of the columns were dropped according to requirement.
I have used line plots to visualize the data for the two graphs. In the first graph, I have divided 4 teams into 4 different subplots for easy understanding by a layman. I have drawn a dotted line across each of the graph to signify the average points over the course of the 12 years to show in which season they performed or underperformed. For example- at the start of the decade we can see the likes of Red Bull and McLaren at the top but as time progressed, we see Mercedes and Ferrari being on top.
Now Coming to the second graph, we can see how the order has shuffled with each year. As you can see, I have divided the graph across three different regions of time-span, this signifies the biggest rule and regulation changes that happened concerning the F1 cars. For example- in this visualisation we can see that McLaren were the most affected team when the V6 1.6L Turbo Hybrid engine was introduced in a span of a year they went from a front running team to a backmarker.
